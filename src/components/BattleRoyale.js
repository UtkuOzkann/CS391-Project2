      Call of Duty: Warzone is a free-to-play battle royale video game released on March 10, 2020, for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Microsoft Windows.
       The game is a part of 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2020's Call of Duty: Black Ops: Cold War (but does not require purchase of them) and was introduced during Season 2 of Modern Warfare content.
        Warzone was developed by Infinity Ward, Raven Software and later Treyarch, and Beenox and published by Activision.
        Warzone allows online multiplayer combat among 150 players, although some limited-time game modes support 200 players.
        The game features both cross-platform play and cross-platform progression between three games.

      </CardText>
      <CardText tag="h6">
      The game features three main modes: Plunder, Resurgence, and Battle Royale.
       Warzone introduces a new in-game currency system which can be used at "Buy Stations" in and around the map.
       "Loadout" drops are an example of where Cash can be traded for limited access to players' custom classes.
       Players may also use Cash to purchase items such as "killstreaks" and gas masks.
       Cash can be found by looting buildings and killing players that have cash on them.
       At launch, Warzone only offered Trios, a squad capacity of three players.
       However, in free post launch content updates, Solos, Duos and Quads have all been added to the game.

              Apex Legends is an online multiplayer battle royale game featuring squads of three players using pre-made characters (called "Legends"), similar to those of hero shooters.
                                 Alternate modes have been introduced allowing for single and for two-player squads since the game's release.
                                 The game is free-to-play and monetized through microtransactions and loot boxes, which allow the player to spend both real money and in-game currency on cosmetic items, such as outfits for the Legends and new colors for weapons.
              <CardText tag="h6">
              Each match generally features twenty teams of three-player squads.
              Players can join friends in a squad or can be matched randomly with other players.
              Before the match, each player on the squad selects one of the 16 playable characters (as of Season 8), with the exception that no character may be selected more than once by a squad.
              Each character in the squad has a unique design, personality, and abilities that provide different playstyles to the team.
